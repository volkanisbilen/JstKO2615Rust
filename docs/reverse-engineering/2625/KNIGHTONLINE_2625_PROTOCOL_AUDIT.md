## Confirmed 2625 addresses

| Purpose | 2615 VA | 2625 VA | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Required GameServer version function | `0x007A87A0` | `0x007AE420` | v2625 returns `2625` |
| Main GameServer packet dispatcher | `0x007AF000` | `0x007B4CE0` | moved |
| Main opcode lookup table | `0x007AF568` | `0x007B5258` | 253 bytes, byte-identical |
| Version response parser | `0x007AF730` | `0x007B5420` | moved; same field order |
| Last received opcode global | `0x01105850` | `0x01114594` | moved |
| Main client/game object | `0x01105834` | `0x01114574` | moved |
| Network/send object | `0x01105914` | `0x01114654` | moved |
| Security cookie/global | `0x010FB680` | `0x010FB680` | unchanged |

## Version packet

The v2625 parser at `sub_7B5420` consumes:

```text
u8  cloak_catalog_selector  (0 = Cloak.tbl, nonzero = Cloak_PVP.tbl)
u16 game_version            (must equal 2625)
u8  aes_key_length          (16)
u8  aes_key[16]
u8  trailer                 (0)
```

The exact server payload is therefore:

```text
00 41 0A 10 <16-byte AES key> 00
```

When the parsed version is not 2625, the client writes `Files=2624` to
`Server.ini`. This is the source of the apparent launcher rollback/update loop
when the launcher and GameServer version domains disagree.

## Opcode audit

The 253-byte compact lookup table used by the main GameServer dispatcher is
byte-for-byte identical between the verified 2615 unpacked executable and the
supplied 2625 executable. The special routes remain:

```text
0x01 -> group 0
0x04 -> group 1
0x2B -> group 2 (version)
0x46 -> group 3
0x72 -> group 4
0x89 -> group 5
0x9F -> group 6
0xA0 -> group 7
other -> group 9
```

Consequently, changing the Rust `Opcode` enum wholesale would be incorrect.
Only version-gated payloads or individually proven sub-opcode changes should be
changed.

## Genie compatibility

The v2625 client still uses Genie marker `0x0197`:

- load/request: `[97 01 01 ...]`, function near `0x00B1EEC0`
- save: `[97 01 03 ...]`, `sub_B1F5A0`
- stop: `[97 01 05 ...]`, function near `0x00B1F7E0`

The save routine still enumerates 32 skill slots. Existing Rust Genie option
serialization therefore remains enabled for v2625; it is not replaced with a
guessed fixed structure.

## Server changes

- Normal GameServer version mode now reads `server_settings.game_version`.
- The hard fallback is 2625.
- LoginServer and GameServer DB versions are migrated together to 2625.
- Historical 2599/2602 wire modes remain available only when explicitly
  selected with `KO_VERSION_MODE` for diagnostics.

## Deployment guard

Do not apply the 2625 migration to the live 2615 service until the 2625 client
patch and launcher files are ready. A live version switch intentionally rejects
the old client.
